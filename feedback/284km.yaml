    I had fun. Motivation often increases when I hear the talks at RubyKaigi, so I thought that having a place to write code with that momentum is a good thing.
    I already know that RUBY_PATCHLEVEL can be used for judging stable and dev/preview.
    I did not know how to judge dev and preview.
    When I was working on CRuby Island, mrkn told me that RUBY_PATCHLEVEL_STR could be used. It was very convenient.

    Yes.

    I hope the code party will be held next time.
